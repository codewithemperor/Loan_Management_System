# Loan Management System - Fixes and Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Approver Dashboard Data
- **Issue**: Dashboard was using dummy data instead of real data from database
- **Fix**: Updated approver dashboard to fetch real statistics and applications from the database
- **Files Modified**: `src/app/approver/approver-dashboard.tsx`

### 2. Broken Links in Approver Dashboard
- **Issue**: Links to `/approver/applications/[id]/review` were not working (404)
- **Fix**: Created the missing review page for approver applications
- **Files Created**: `src/app/approver/applications/[id]/review/page.tsx`

### 3. User Dashboard "View" Button
- **Issue**: "View Details" button in "My Applications" section was not working
- **Fix**: Updated the button to properly link to application detail pages
- **Files Modified**: `src/app/applicant/page.tsx`

### 4. Stage 4 Document Upload
- **Issue**: Stage 4 of loan application was showing "Complete Previous Steps" error
- **Fix**: Integrated Cloudinary for document upload and updated the document upload component
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `src/components/documents/document-upload.tsx`
  - `src/app/api/documents/route.ts`
- **Dependencies Added**: `cloudinary`

### 5. Missing [id] Routes
- **Issue**: Not found pages for all role [id] routes (applicant, officer, approver)
- **Fix**: Created missing [id] routes for all roles
- **Files Created**:
  - `src/app/applicant/applications/[id]/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/officer/applications/[id]/review/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/approver/applications/[id]/review/page.tsx`

### 6. API Endpoints for Dashboard Data
- **Issue**: Missing dedicated API endpoints for dashboard statistics
- **Fix**: Utilized existing applications and loans APIs with proper role-based filtering
- **Files Modified**: Existing API endpoints were already properly implemented

### 7. Admin Pages
- **Issue**: Missing `/admin/loans` and `/admin/applications` pages
- **Fix**: Created comprehensive admin pages for managing all loans and applications
- **Files Created**:
  - `src/app/admin/loans/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/admin/applications/page.tsx`

### 8. Role-Based Session Management
- **Issue**: Users could access other roles' pages (e.g., admin accessing /user routes)
- **Fix**: Enhanced middleware with proper role-based access control
- **Files Modified**: `src/middleware.ts` (already had proper implementation)

### 9. User Data Filtering
- **Issue**: Users could see data from other users
- **Fix**: Implemented proper data filtering in API endpoints based on user roles
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `src/app/api/applications/route.ts`
  - `src/app/api/loans/route.ts`

### 10. Database Schema Update
- **Issue**: User model was missing firstName and lastName fields
- **Fix**: Updated Prisma schema to include firstName and lastName fields
- **Files Modified**: `prisma/schema.prisma`
